### Cloud Engineer | Microbiology & HR Specialist | Tech Enthusiast

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a passionate undergraduate of **Cloud Engineering** from **AltSchool Africa**, driven to create innovative and reliable cloud-based solutions. My unique journey began in Microbiology and Human Resource Management, and has evolved into the world of Cloud Engineering‚Äîa transition that was profoundly influenced by my role as a young mother and one of five female children in my family. I've always been motivated to positively influence the future for the next generation, and witnessing the transformative power of digital environments compelled me to understand and actively shape the world my son and siblings will inherit.

This motivation fuels my commitment to mastering cloud technologies and DevOps practices, which are essential to building scalable, secure, and innovative solutions that benefit businesses and communities alike. At AltSchool Africa, I've honed my skills in cloud infrastructure, automation, and continuous integration and delivery pipelines, preparing me to tackle real-world challenges with creativity and resilience.
